Non-Privileged user -to- privileged user:
-----------------------------------------

visudo 

###set the permission to the Non-Privileged user as same like the  root has.

root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
murali  ALL=(ALL)       ALL

#save the file and exit

##try running super_user commands with a prefix of sudo commmon

sudo fdisk -l

##for the first time in a session, system would ask your password for running a super user commond with sudo prefix
##from the next time, the system will not ask for the password while running any super user commond with sudo prefix.

### the same visudo can also be done with "vi /etc/sudoers"

murali  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
##NOPASSWD allows me to run super user commonds with sudo prefix, without password

### in this case "sudo -i" can make to login as root user without any password

STICKY_BIT:
-----------

##It is a common area, where users can write their files and none of the other users can delete/modify an user file/dir. Precisely as usual "root" user can delete/modify any users file/dir.


creating a sticky_bit:
----------------------

mkdir /test

chmod 777 /test

chmod o+t /test
 
### a good example of sticky_bit is "/tmp" by default.
