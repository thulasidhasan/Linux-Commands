Linux:
======

* It is an operating system

* Multi user Environment - remote 

* Flavour of Unix

* REDHAT ENTERPRISE LINUX - RHEL

System:
=======

Input ----> Processing ------> Output
		       ------> Error

STDIN 0
STDOUT 1
STDERR 2 

Access:
=======

* Authentication

	a) Username & Password  -- text CLI command Line Interface
	b) Finger Print - Bio_Metric -- GUI Graphical User Interface
	c) Face recognization -- GUI Graphical User Interface
	d) Key Based auth -- CLI & GUI

ROOT:
=====

The Top most object in Linux file system hierarchy is the root  / 

The directories can be compared to Branches in a tree

The Files can be compared to the Leaves

For example:

/etc/sysconfig/network

commands:
---------

pwd - present working directory

whoami - which user i have logged in as ?

##user=root , highly previleged user -- super user

useradd <user_name>  ### user creation
passwd <user_name>   ### change/apply password to an user
su <user_name>   ### switch user
exit     ### back to the previous shell
hostname   ### shows the present machine's name
cd ~    ### go to home dir
su - <user_name>  ### switch user plus change pwd to the user's home


#### Non-Previleged Users ---- /home/<user_name>

#### for root user ---- the home directory is /root

a) / -- top most object of a file system called ROOT

b) root  -- user, who is highly previleged

c) /root -- the home directory of the user: root


what is a Shell ?

Shell is an interface between the system and the user
