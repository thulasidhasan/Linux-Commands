LVM:
====

Logical Volume Manager:

what is the need ?

1) online (mounted) or offline (unmounted) extending is not possible with using direct partition or device as file system.

2) Direct recovery of Partition is also not possible

3) Migrating a partition is also a tough task

4) Mirroring a partition is not possible

5) all the above 4 statements are common for both device with Partition and the device without partition

what is LVM ?

one or more disks (physical volume) clubbed together to form a volume group, from which Logical volumes can me made.

Commands for creation :
=======================

1) pvcreate <device>

2) vgcreate <new_vg_name> <pv_name>

3) lvcreate -L <size> -n <lv_name> <vg_name>

	(or) 

3) lvcreate -l <extents> -n <lv_name> <vg_name>


for display :
=============

1) pvs & pvdisplay

2) vgs & vgdisplay

3) lvs & lvdisplay


extents:
========

Physical extents are units of default size 4MB or while creating the Volume Group the size can be altered.

for example:

1GB = 256 extents while single extent=4MB.


How to address a physical volume ?

/dev/sdb /dev/sdc1   ..... same name of the device itself

How to address a Volume Group ?

<vg_name>

How to address a Logical Volume ?

/dev/vg_name/lv_name

	(or)

/dev/mapper/vg_name-lv_name
