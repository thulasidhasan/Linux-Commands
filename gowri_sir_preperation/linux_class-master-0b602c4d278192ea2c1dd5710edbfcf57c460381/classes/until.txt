The until loop:
==============

The until loop is very similar to the while loop, except that the loop executes until the TEST-COMMAND executes successfully. As long as this command fails, the loop continues. The syntax is the same as for the while loop:

until TEST-COMMAND; do CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS; done

The return status is the exit status of the last command executed in the CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS list, or zero if none was executed. TEST-COMMAND can, again, be any command that can exit with a success or failure status, and CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS can be any UNIX command, script or shell construct.


#!/bin/sh

a=0

until [ ! $a -lt 10 ]
do
   echo $a
   a=`expr $a + 1`
done



#!/bin/bash
i=1
until [ $i -gt 6 ]
do
	echo "Welcome $i times."
	i=$(( i+1 ))
done


#!/bin/bash
# checking until command
num=10
until [ $num -eq o ]
do
echo $num
num=$[$num-1]
done
