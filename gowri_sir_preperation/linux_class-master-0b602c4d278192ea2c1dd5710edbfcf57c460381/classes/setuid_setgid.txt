setuid:
-------

chmod u+s <executable_file>


Out of the super user command set (/sbin & /usr/sbin or /usr/local/sbin) if any of the commands needs to be given to unprivileged user's execution, then setuid can be used.


setgid:
-------

same like setuid, but here the permission added to the group owner of the file

chmod g+s <executable_file>
