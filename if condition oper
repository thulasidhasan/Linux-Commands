-gt	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	[ $a -gt $b ] is not true.

-lt	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	[ $a -lt $b ] is true.
-ge	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	[ $a -ge $b ] is not true.
