SHELL:
======

What is a shell?

Shell is nothing but an interface between the user and the system (OS)

Is shell programming a structured programming language ?

No

For example:

C C++ Java are all structured programming languages.

where in as shell programming contains group of Linux commands with condition, looping, function, variables..etc

Bang:
=====
Bang for shell programming can be :

#!/bin/bash
or
#!/bin/ksh
or
#!/bin/csh


what is a Bang ?

Bang is a reference through which the script is been understood while executing.

why Bang becomes necessory?

for example: 

we can run any script (shell, python, perl, go) if the script has got executable permission.

path of the script can be called for exection or if the script is in the current directory, can be called for execution as: ./script

Regardless of execting a script without a command like python perl sh, the bang should be there.


Here in the entire classes we will see #!/bin/bash as the bang.
And at the end of the course, we will see the differences between various shells.


STDIN ?

the standard input given to the system thorugh keyboard

In Numbers: 0

STDOUT =1

the processed output given by the system through the monitor 


STDERR =2 ?

the unacceptable command/syntax errors and warnings given by the system through the monitor

In Numbers: 2


Let's prove:

make a program starts with #!/bin/bash as bang
then having the below commands
ls
lsa

we know that "ls" is a proper command for listing

but "lsa" is not a valid command

make the file executable 

now execute:

result : 

a STDOUT =1
a STDERR =2

1) eleminate the STDERR

./script 2>/dev/null

Note: /dev/null is a NULL device which can take inputs and sparsh

2) eleminate the STDOUT 

./script 1>/dev/null

3) eleminate both

./script >/dev/null 2>&1

================================================================= 

output redirection:
===================

>   single redirection

>>  double redirection


Note: This is used to redirect the output to a file


for example:
============

ls > file1  ###creates a file with the output

ls >> file1 ###updates/appends the file with the output

Do you get STDOUT/STDERR while redirecting ?

if the command has error, then the error appears in the STDERR and if there is any STDOUT goes only to the file and not to the monitor

./script 2 > file3  ### catches only the error

./script > file4 ###catches only the STDOUT

we shall redirect both (STDOUT + STDERR) 

./script > file5 2>&1


tee:
====

this command does multiple redirection

./script |tee file8

./script 2>&1 | tee file9

Note: Be careful while using tee command, because it overwrite the output file.

./script |tee -a file10 ###appends

Variables:
==========
for example:

x+5=6 

what is the value of x ?

1

same like that 

x=1

echo "$x"

echo '$x'

sample program:
---------------

#!/bin/bash
Name=Sandeep   ### here Name is a variable (initialize)
Age=25         ### here Age is a variable  (initialize)
echo "The name is $Name and his age is $Age"  (utilizing)

Note: while expressing/using the variable we need to give $ before it. The value of a variable can be changed in running.

same program with echo having single quotes:
--------------------------------------------

The name is $Name and his age is $Age
The name is $Name and his age is $Age

Escape sequence:
----------------

[root@veecube7 shell]# echo """ ###is wrong
> ^C
[root@veecube7 shell]# echo "\""  ###is right
"
Note: Escape sequence will not work inside single quotes

please try to print \

[root@veecube7 shell]# echo "\\"
\

STDIN:
------

read:
-----

#!/bin/bash
echo "Please enter the Name"
read a
echo "Please enter the Age"
read b
echo "The name is $a and the age is $b"

###displaying the request/order/message using read command

read -p "Please enter the Name: " a
read -p "Please enter the Age: " b

Command line Argument:
----------------------

Note: CLIARG should be given in the execution command line of the script

./script sandeep 25

here 
	$0 is the script 
	$1 is sandeep
	$2 is 25

#!/bin/bash
echo "The name is $1 and the age is $2"

to count the number of CLIARG inputs

echo "$#"

sample program:

#!/bin/bash
echo "The name of the script is $0"
echo "The number of argumants given in the command line are: $#"
echo "The \$1 is $1 and the \$2 is $2"
echo "The name is $1 and the age is $2"
echo "The arguments given in the command line are: $*"
echo "The arguments given in the command line are: $@"
echo "The whole command line is: sh $0 $*"
echo "The whole command line is: sh $0 $@"

Arithmatic operation:
=====================

add  +
sub  - 
mul  \*
div  \/
mod  %
avg  55 \/ 65 \*100

command : expr

expr $a + $b
expr $a - $b
expr $a \* $b
expr $a \/ $b
expr $a % $b
expr $a \/ $b \* 100

Assign a command to variable:
-----------------------------
Example1:
---------

my_machine=`hostname`

or 

my_machine=$(hostname)

echo "$my_machine"


Example2:
---------

c=`expr $a + $b`
c=$(expr $a + $b)
echo "the added value of $a and $b is $c"

Write a calculator program and take two inputs and do add,sub,mul,div,mod,avg


Pipe Line Sequence:
===================

1) grep "void: -v" "case_senstive_less: -i" "recurssive: -r"
2) cut
3) sort
4) wc  "line: wc -l"  "word: wc -w" "char: wc -c"  
5) head
6) tail
7) uniq

some result been put to a pipe 

|   symbol for pipe

Examples:
---------

ls -l / |grep ^d

$# stores all the commandline arguments

cat /etc/passwd | grep bash$

cat /etc/passwd | grep bash$ |wc -l

grep void:
----------

grep -v bash$ /etc/passwd |wc -l

cat /etc/passwd | wc -l 

grep root /etc/passwd |wc -l

grep sys /etc/passwd |wc -l

grep -i sys /etc/passwd |wc -l

what is delimeter ?

delimeter is a separator


echo " hi hello how are you? "  ###here space_bar is the delimeter

grep root /etc/passwd   ### what is the delimeter ?

user_name:passwd:uid:gid:description:home_dir:shell

cut -d ":" -f1 /etc/passwd  ### shows only the user_name

user_name:shell  #### cut -d ":" -f 1,7 /etc/passwd

cutting the char:
-----------------

echo "hi hello how are you?"|cut -c1,2,3,4,5


head:
-----
to display only the first line:  head -1 /etc/passwd

to display first 3 lines: head -3 /etc/passwd

to display the last line: tail -1 /etc/passwd

to display last 2 lines: tail -2 /etc/passwd

to display the 15th line: head -15 /etc/passwd |tail -1


cut -d ":" -f1 /etc/passwd  ###rough output
cut -d ":" -f1 /etc/passwd|sort   ###sorted output

sort file10  ###sorted output with duplicates
sort -u file10  ### without duplicates
sort file10|uniq -d  ###shows only the duplicates


Write a program to take inputs:

group_name
gid
user_name
uid
description
home_dir
shell


groupadd --gid <gid> group_name
useradd --gid <gid> --uid <uid> -c "<description>" --home <home_dir> --shell <shell> <user_name>

grep ^<user_name> /etc/passwd
grep ^<group_name> /etc/group

bc: binory calculator
---------------------

echo "5+10" | bc
echo "$a+$b" |bc
echo "$a*$b" |bc
echo "10/3" |bc

output to a variable:
---------------------

result=$(echo "10/3" |bc)
or
result=`echo "10/3" |bc`
