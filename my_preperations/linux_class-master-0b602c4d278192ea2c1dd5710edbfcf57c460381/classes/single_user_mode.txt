For RHEL6:
-----------

Single User Mode:
-----------------

go to the console and press any key while booting, you would get GRUB boot menu kernel version line

there press 'e' then go to the second line (Kernel) then press 'e', give 'space' then '1'

press enter, then press 'b'

e edit
b boot
1 single user mode

once after getting to single user mode:

chage -E -1 root 

(or) 

chage -M 99999 root

if you want to keep you shadow file attributed then:

chattr +ia /etc/shadow (no local accounts passwd can be changed)

to remove the attribute 

chattr -ia /etc/shadow


For RHEL7:
----------

1) First restart your CentOS 7 machine, once boot process starts, wait for the GRUB boot menu to appear 

2) Next, select your Kernel version from the grub menu item and press e key to edit the first boot option

3) Now use the Down arrow key to find the kernel line (starts with “linux16“), then change the argument ro to rw init=/sysroot/bin/sh 

4) Once you have finished the task in the previous step, press Ctrl-X or F10 to boot into single user mode (access an emergency shell).

5) Now mount root (/) filesystem using the following command.

chroot /sysroot/

mount -o rw,remount /

Now you can change the root password by typing the passwd command. But that is not done. We need to relabel SELinux context. 
If we skip relabeling the whole SELinux context we would be able to login using using password.

# passwd root
[Enter New Password]
[Re-enter New Password]

# touch /.autorelabel

6) if you want to set age for password or to disable expiry use the chage command given above for RHEL6


Note : In both RHEL6 & RHEL7 you need to reboot the machine, once everything is done
