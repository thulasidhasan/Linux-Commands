FACTS in ANSIBLE:
-----------------

This module is automatically called by playbooks to gather useful variables about remote hosts that can be used in playbooks. It can also be executed directly by /usr/bin/ansible to check what variables are available to a host. Ansible provides many facts about the system, automatically.

 Display facts from all hosts and store them indexed by I(hostname) at C(/tmp/facts).
#  

# Display only facts regarding memory found by ansible on all hosts and output them.
# ansible all -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_*_mb'

# Display only facts returned by facter.
# ansible all -m setup -a 'filter=facter_*'

# Collect only facts returned by facter.
# ansible all -m setup -a 'gather_subset=!all,!any,facter'

# Display only facts about certain interfaces.
# ansible all -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_eth[0-2]'

# Restrict additional gathered facts to network and virtual (includes default minimum facts)
# ansible all -m setup -a 'gather_subset=network,virtual'

# Collect only network and virtual (excludes default minimum facts)
# ansible all -m setup -a 'gather_subset=!all,!any,network,virtual'

# Do not call puppet facter or ohai even if present.
# ansible all -m setup -a 'gather_subset=!facter,!ohai'

# Only collect the default minimum amount of facts:
# ansible all -m setup -a 'gather_subset=!all'
