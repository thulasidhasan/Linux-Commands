Directory Use:
==============


/  The root directory. This is where the file system tree starts.

/bin  In here, you find executable programs that are needed to repair a system in a minimal troubleshooting mode. This directory is essential during boot.

/boot 	Contains all files and directories that are needed to boot the Linux kernel.

/dev Device files that are used for accessing physical devices. This directory is essential during boot.

for Eg: /dev/hda   IDE HDD
	/dev/sda   SATA/SCSI/SAS
	/dev/mda   RAID


/etc Contains configuration files that are used by programs and services that are used on your server. This directory is essential during boot.


/home Used for local user home directories.


/lib, /lib64 Shared libraries that are used by programs in /boot, /bin and /sbin


/media, /mnt Directories that are used for mounting devices in the file system tree


/opt This directory is used for optional packages that may be installed on your server.


/srv Directory that may be used for data that is used by services like NFS, FTP and HTTP .


/sys 	Used as an interface to different hardware devices that is managed by the Linux kernel and associated processes.


/proc	This directory is used by the proc file system. This is a file system structure that gives access to kernel information.


/root The home directory of the root user.


/run Contains process and user specific information that has been created since the last boot.


/sbin is Like /bin, but for system administration commands that are not necessarily needed by regular users.


/tmp Contains temporary files that may be deleted without any warning during boot.


/usr 		Directory that contains subdirectories with program files, libraries for these program files and documentation about them. Typically, many	subdirectories exist in this directory that mimic the contents of the / directory. The contents of /usr are not required during boot.


/var Directory that contains files which may change in size dynamically, 	such as log files, mail boxes, and spool files.
