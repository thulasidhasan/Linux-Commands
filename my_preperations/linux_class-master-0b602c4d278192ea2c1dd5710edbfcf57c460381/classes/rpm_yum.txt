Packages:
=========

* any command or any file or any directory got created in the machine while installing the Operating System is only out of packages.

* After the installation, the requirement for repository araises when the system needs more packages to be installed.


to view all the packages installed in a system :
------------------------------------------------

rpm -qa  ##query all

to view all the packages installed in a system by order :
---------------------------------------------------------

rpm -qa --last

to list the files from a package:
---------------------------------

rpm -ql <package_name> ##query list

to list only the configuration files in a package:
---------------------------------------------------

rpm -qc <package_name>

format of a package_name:
-------------------------
<name>-<major_version>.<minor_version>.<patch_release>.<rhel>.<arch>

arch:
-----
i386 -- 32bit
i686 -- 32bit
x86_64 -- 64bit
noarch -- any arch

rhel:
-----
cat /etc/redhat_release

uname -r ### kernel version  (please refer the man page of uname)

in package name : the rhel is el5 for RHEL5, el6 RHEL6 & el7 for RHEL7

to install a package:
---------------------

*we need rpm file

rpm -ivh <package.rpm>   ### i - install v-verbose h-human readable


to upgrade a package:
---------------------

rpm -Uvh <package.rpm>  ### U - Upgrade


to check package been installed or not:
---------------------------------------

rpm -qa | grep <package*>

to remove a package:
--------------------

rpm -e <package_full_name>

to mount a cd/iso:
------------------

mount /dev/sr0 /mnt -o loop,ro

*only one package can be handled at a time
*dependency has to be resolved manually

======================================================
YUM: Yello Dog Update Manager:
-------------------------------

*resolves dependency automatically

* RHEL uses YUM as the default repository, which is manually needed to be created. 

* Else we can share the available repository in other machines through FTP or HTTP.

* So there are totally three options to create a baseurl for repository :

1) ftp://<ip>/<path>    Remote file transfer protocol repository.

2) http://<ip>/<path>   Remote Web server repository.

3) file://<path>     Local and cannot be shared to another machine.

* yum repository uses xml metadata

* Main directory for YUM repo files :  /etc/yum.repos.d

Yum repo creation:
------------------

Method A:
---------

1) add your OS iso/DVD to the machine

2) move all the *.repo from /etc/yum.repos.d to /tmp

3) mount the iso/DVD to /mnt

mount /dev/sr0 /mnt -o loop,ro

4) create a repo file (local.repo) under /etc/yum.repos.d

[repo]
name=local
baseurl=file:///mnt
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1

##save and exit 

what is gpgcheck ?
------------------
(If set to 1, verify the authenticity of the packages by checking the GPG signatures. You might need to set gpgcheck to 0 if a package is unsigned, but you should be wary that the package could have been maliciously altered.)


yum clean all (clears the cache)
yum repolist (shows the available repositories)

yum install createrepo -y

yum install vsftpd -y

very safe file transfer protocol daemon -- vsftpd

Method B:
---------

1) add your OS iso/DVD to the machine

2) move all the *.repo from /etc/yum.repos.d to /tmp

3) mount the iso/DVD to /mnt

mount /dev/sr0 /mnt -o loop,ro

4) cd /mnt/Packages

5) rpm -ivh createrepo....rpm (will ask two dependencies)

6) Install depndencies in upfront then install createrepo...rpm

7) rpm -ivh vsftpd....rpm

for both the Methods A & B:
---------------------------
(vsftpd is a service which creates ftp user in /etc/passwd)
(home dir of ftp user can be filtered from /etc/passwd)

cp -ra /mnt/Packages /var/ftp/pub

createrepo /var/ftp/pub/Packages (creates xml metadata)

##start the ftp 

service vsftpd start (to start in RHEL6)
chkconfig vsftpd on (to bring up the service on next reboot)


systemctl start vsftpd.service (in RHEL7)
systemctl enable vsftpd.service


###edit the repo file (local.repo) /etc/yum.repos.d

###change the baseurl to ftp://<ip>/pub/Packages

yum clean all

yum repolist

###provided the same repo file can be copied to another machine for yum repo



yum commands:
============

yum install <package_name> -y

yum reinstall <package_name> -y

yum remove <package_name> -y

yum repolist    => what are all the repositories available

yum list ldap*    => way of search

yum search ldap   => way of search

yum provides */<command>

yum groupinstall <group_package_name>

yum clean all
