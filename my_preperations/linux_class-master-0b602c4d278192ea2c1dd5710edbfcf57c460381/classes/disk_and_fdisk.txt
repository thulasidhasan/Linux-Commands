fdisk:
------

* used for partitioning the disk

The first 512 bytes (Cyl 0, Sec 1) of the disk has 

1) MBR - Master boot record, having info about where the Kernel and Initial RAM disk is stored

	a) Kernel is the core of the OS
	b) Initial RAM disk acts as a temp root while booting
	c) Initial RAM disk has additional drivers for the kernel to understand the Hardware 
	d) size of the MBR is 446

2) Partition table 64 bytes


3) Magic Bytes - validation of the MBR. 2 bytes in size  


commands:
---------

fdisk -l (list)

fdisk </dev/<disk>>

disk naming:
------------

IDE HDD --- hda

SATA HDD --- same like scsi sda

SCSI HDD --- sda

RAID HDD --- mda

note:  device needs to be specified with absolute path like "/dev/sda"

scanning:
---------

* after adding a disk

echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host<number>/scan

the 3 '-'s  :
--------------
The three values stand for channel, SCSI target ID, and LUN. 
The dashes act as wildcards meaning "rescan everything"

what is LUN:
------------

Logical unit number

Logical unit number (LUN) can refer to an entire physical disk, 
or a subset of a larger physical disk or disk volume. 

*after scanning

dmesg

Log for hardware changes

The dmesg Command. The dmesg command is used to write the kernel 
messages in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems to 
standard output (which by default is the display screen).

Note: dmesg, doesn't have a time stamp

(or) lsscsi can show the overall Block devices in the machine
