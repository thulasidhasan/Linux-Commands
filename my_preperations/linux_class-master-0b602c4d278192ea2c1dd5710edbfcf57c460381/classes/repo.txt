Packages:
=========

* any command or any file or any directory got created in the machine while installing the Operating System is only out of packages.

* After the installation, the requirement for repository araises when the system needs more packages to be installed.

* RHEL uses YUM as the default repository, which is manually needed to be created. 

* Else we can share the available repository in other machines through FTP or HTTP.

* So there are totally three options to create a baseurl for repository :

1) ftp://<ip>/<path>    Remote file transfer protocol repository.

2) http://<ip>/<path>   Remote Web server repository.

3) file://<path>     Local and cannot be shared to another machine.

* yum repository uses xml metadata

* Main directory for YUM repo files :  /etc/yum.repos.d

yum commands:
============

yum install <package_name> -y

yum reinstall <package_name> -y

yum remove <package_name> -y
