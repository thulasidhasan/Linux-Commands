--------------

what is MAC id ?

A media access control address (MAC address) of a device is an unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer of a network segment.

MAC id is the "HWADDR" entry in the Network Configuration File

Use "ip addr show" to configure and monitor network addresses
Use "ip route show" to configure and monitor routing information
Use "ip link show" to configure and monitor network link state

ifconfig :
----------

ifconfig --- interface config

shows all the Active Network Interfaces of the system 

ifconfig <NIC> : shows a particular NIC

ethtool:
--------
ethtool is a utility for Linux kernel-based operating system for displaying and modifying some parameters of network interface controllers (NICs) and their device drivers.

ip route get <ip>
-----------------

to know, through which interface the network connection happens.

routing table:
--------------

route -n

traceroute & tracepath :
------------------------

Tracepath and traceroute are very similiar network mapping commands. The main difference between the two is that you need to be a superuser on a Linux computer to use traceroute, whereas tracepath can be run without this

traceroute <ip/host>

tracepath <ip/host>

where to find the available network interfaces in a machine ?

cat /proc/net/dev

configuration Directory:
------------------------

/etc/sysconfig/network-script

NIC card configure file : ifcfg-eth0 ifcfg-ens32 

where in as eth stands for ethernet , if --- interface, cfg --- config and ens --- Ethereum Name Service


To up/down an interface:
------------------------

ifup <if_name> 

ifdown <if_name>

For the whole Network:
----------------------

service network start/stop/reload/restart/status

systemctl start/stop/reload/restart/status/enable/disable network.service
